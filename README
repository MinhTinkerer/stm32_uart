stm32_uart
==========
Module UART for STM32F10x. Can be used with FreeRTOS (uncomment USE_FREERTOS define).
This code is non-blocking, because of using RX and TX interrupts, circullar buffers and staff.
Also can be used semaphore to block task while waiting incomming data.

TODO:
 * some speed optimization
 * buffer overflow protection and error handling
 * mutex for sending data to UART
